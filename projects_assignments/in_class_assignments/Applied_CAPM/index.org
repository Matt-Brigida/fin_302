Choose a stock with a ticker that start with the same letter as your last name.  Calculate and report the beta coefficient for that stock.  

-  You can download [[https://iextrading.com/apps/stocks/][stock price data from the IEX.]]
-  You can use the regression feature in Excel or simply use the ==slope()= function.
-  Tell me what the beta coefficient is.  If you simply run a regression and provide the results **you will get no credit because it is not clear you know what the beta coefficient is**.  At the top of whatever you submit it should say:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Stock X's beta coefficient is Y.
#+END_QUOTE
