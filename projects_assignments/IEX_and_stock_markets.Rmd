# Assignment

You can use my [R wrapper of the IEX API](https://github.com/Matt-Brigida/IEX_API_R_Wrapper), or [simply the html interface](https://iextrading.com/apps/stocks).

Choose a stock and answer the following questions.  Do not pick the same stock as anyone else.

#.  At how many stock exchanges do you see trades in the stock?

#.  Report the amount of trading which has occurred at each exchange.

#.  What is the largest trade and where did it occur?

#.  What is the bid/ask spread on the ExOne company (ticker: XONE)?  What is the bid/ask for your stock?

#.  Has your stock generally beat, met, or missed earnings?

#.  What is your company's float/market cap/dividend yield?
