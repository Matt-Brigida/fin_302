# Assignment: An Introduction to Stock Markets and the IEX

You can use my [R wrapper of the IEX API](https://github.com/Matt-Brigida/IEX_API_R_Wrapper), or [simply the html interface](https://iextrading.com/apps/stocks).

Choose a stock and answer the following questions.  Do not pick the same stock as anyone else.

1.  At how many stock exchanges do you see trades in the stock?

2.  Report the amount of trading which has occurred at each exchange.

3.  What is the largest trade and where did it occur?

4.  What is the bid/ask spread on the ExOne company (ticker: XONE)?  What is the bid/ask for your stock?

5.  Has your stock generally beat, met, or missed earnings?

6.  What is your company's float/market cap/dividend yield?
